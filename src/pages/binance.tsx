            <h3>Rewards in your wallet</h3>
            <p>
              BabyShib may be cute, but it has quite the bite! $BabyShib is a
              dividend meme token designed to continually distribute $BabyShib
              to its holders. All BabyShib holders earn more $Babyshib simply by
              holding BabyShib tokens in their wallets, and these funds are
              automatically sent to your wallet. As BabyShib token holders, you
              automatically receive a 5% fee from every transaction that occurs
              on the BSC chain, which means your $BabyShib holdings in your
              wallet will continue to grow. A minimum of holding 100 billion
              tokens is required to receive dividend payouts
